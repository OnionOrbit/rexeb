# rexeb
Rexeb is a modern, high-performance command-line tool written in Rust that converts Debian (.deb) packages to Arch Linux packages (.pkg.tar.zst). It's designed as a faster and more reliable alternative to debtap, with improved dependency resolution, parallel processing, and a clean CLI interface.
